# Craig's GYM website

## User-Centric Frontend Development Milestone Project.

GYM - my first milestone project - a site showing all of the benefits and features of our gym.
## [Link to finished GYM site](https://craigmantona.github.io/GYM-project/)

This is my GYM website that I have made by using the skills and code from the course so far (Love running, CV, Whiskey Drop to mention a few.)

This website has been made with an established gym in mind. I have tried to make a website that is easy to access, and that has similar visuals/colour themes throughout. It should be fully accessible on a range of devices and simple to navigate for new GYM users and regular members.
I have visited several gym sites in my life and I have tried to encourporate all of the information that I considered to be vital. I have asked some friends and family for their input, and have added some extra features as a result of that interaction.

## Structure of the website

This website has been made with an established gym in mind. 
I have tried to make a website that is easy to access, and that has similar visuals/colour themes throughout. 
It should be fully accessible on a range of devices and simple to navigate for new GYM users and regular members.
I have visited several gym sites in my life and I have tried to encourporate all of the information that I considered to be vital. 
I have asked some friends and family for their input, and have added some extra features as a result of that interaction.

## Wireframes

I used the site Balsamiq to create the wireframes for the site.

## Surface

### Colors
Main colours used in a project:
* background color: whitesmoke
* font color: #212529, tomato, and f5f5f5


### Fonts 

* The Merriweather font is the main font used throughout the whole website with Serif as the fallback font in case for any reason the font isn't being imported into the site correctly. Merriweather is a clean and clear font, so it is both attractive and appropriate.

### Images

* All images are credited in [credits](#credits) section.

## Issues found during site development

* Original font used - Bebas Neue - was replaced as the all caps view seemed a bit aggresive throughout the site.

* The Website was tested on Google Chrome, Internet Explorer, Microsoft Edge and Safari browsers.

* The website was viewed on a variety of devices such as Desktop, Laptop, iPhone8, iPad Pro & iPhone11.

* Friends and family members were asked to review the site and documentation to point out any bugs and/or user experience issues.

* I got my wife, brother and a friend to test the site as a 'new visitor'. Some styling ideas were put forward resulting in some font colour changes and a different look to the gym classes descriptions view.
My mentor also looked through it when I was part way through and advised me to change the font and also to compress the images so the site would load quicker.

* Linking issue within the navbar corrected after testing. Home gage icon was not set to link to Home page and was therefore linking to an error 404 page instead.

* Images were only showing up on local site and not the website. Changed the linking to the images to rectify issue.


## Performance testing

I ran [Lighthouse](https://developers.google.com/web/tools/lighthouse/) tool to check performance of the website.
Screenshots are presented below:

<img src="/assets/images/lighthouse.png" alt="Images of performance from Lighthouse."/>


### Known bugs
On some mobile devices the videos of the Personal Trainers are seen as still images.
